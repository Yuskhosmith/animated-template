# Hello 😏

So, this just animates this [template](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation) which was built with tailwind css.

The animation was done by using the [animate on scroll library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) by michalsnik.

## .New
I learnt the difference between <script>, <sript async>, and <script defer>. I also learnt the order of prioprity i.e. which JS should load first, Should the JS load before the HTML and many more.

```
<script> </script>
<script async> </script>
<script defer> </script>

```
